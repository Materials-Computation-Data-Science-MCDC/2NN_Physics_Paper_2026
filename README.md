Dominant role of second nearest-neighbor bonding in strength-ductility tradeoff of bcc refractory high entropy alloys


This repository provides all the relaxed structures for Binary, ternary quaternary and quinary alloys used in our study. We have nested directories according to Alloy complexity (Binary, ternary, quaternary and quinary), Alloy compoition (50_50, 25_25_25, 22_50_28) and Alloy name (WMo, WMoZr, WMoNb).
